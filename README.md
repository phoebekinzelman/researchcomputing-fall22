# GEOS 505: Research Computing in the Earth & Environmental Sciences

## 🌈 Phoebe Kinzelman

### ❄️ Research Overview
I use a Python-based automated terminus mapping method applied to the Landsat 7 and 8 record to track terminus changes of marine-terminating glaciers spanning Greenland’s periphery! In addition to Python, I also use Matlab and QGIS.

### ✍🏻 Goals
1. Successfully take code I've written in Jupyter Notebook and push it to a Git repo with no errors
2. Understand the meaning behind different error codes (0, 255, etc.)
3. Have a working knowledge of Markdown, Python, & Bash
